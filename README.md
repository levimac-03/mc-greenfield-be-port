# <span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>: Java to Bedrock Port

Welcome to the <span style="color:green;">**Greenfield**</span> port! This is the largest city in Minecraft, originally for Java Edition, now brought to Bedrock Edition.

## How It Was Done

We used **Amulet V0.10.35** to make this port happen, carefully converting the entire map to work smoothly in Bedrock. It took time and effort, but now you can explore <span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span> on your favorite Bedrock device.

Enjoy the city!

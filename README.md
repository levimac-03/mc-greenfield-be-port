# <span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>: Java to Bedrock Port

Welcome to the **<span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>** port. This repository hosts the largest city in Minecraft, originally designed for Java Edition, now available for Bedrock Edition.

## How It Was Done

This conversion was completed using **Amulet V0.10.35** to ensure the map functions correctly in Bedrock Edition. The version converted is **Greenfield v0.5.4**, the latest version available. For more details on the tool, visit [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

## Why Amulet?

Amulet was chosen over JE2BE for several reasons:

- **Chunk Control:** Precise management of individual chunks, essential for a large map like Greenfield.
- **Entity Handling:** Effective preservation of entities and tile entities during conversion.
- **NBT Data Support:** Maintains all crucial map details through the conversion.

While JE2BE is good for simple conversions, Amulet provides the control and flexibility needed for a complex map like Greenfield.

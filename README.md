# <span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>: Java to Bedrock Port

Welcome to the **<span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>** port. This repository hosts the largest city in Minecraft, originally designed for Java Edition, now available for Bedrock Edition.

## How It Was Done

This conversion was accomplished using **Amulet V0.10.35**. The entire map was carefully converted to ensure it functions correctly in Bedrock Edition. For more information about the tool used, visit [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

# Why We Chose Amulet for the Greenfield Conversion

## Why Amulet?
We chose Amulet over JE2BE for converting the Greenfield map from Minecraft Java Edition to Bedrock Edition for a few key reasons:

### **What Makes Amulet Stand Out:**

- **Chunk Control:** Amulet offers precise management of individual chunks, which is crucial given Greenfield’s extensive size.

- **Entity Handling:** It effectively manages entities and tile entities, ensuring that all important features and details are preserved during the conversion.

- **NBT Data Support:** Amulet’s ability to edit NBT data helps maintain all essential map details throughout the conversion process.

### **Why Not JE2BE?**
While JE2BE is useful for straightforward conversions, it doesn’t provide the same level of control and flexibility as Amulet. With Amulet, we can handle the complexities of a large map like Greenfield more effectively.

### **What This Means**
Using Amulet ensures a more accurate and detailed conversion of Greenfield, keeping its intricate design intact. It’s the right tool for the job when dealing with such a large and complex map.

# <span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>: Java to Bedrock Port

Welcome to the **<span style="color:green;">Greenfield</span>** port. This repository hosts the largest city in Minecraft, originally designed for Java Edition, now available for Bedrock Edition.

## How It Was Done

This conversion was accomplished using **Amulet V0.10.35**. The entire map was carefully converted to ensure it functions correctly in Bedrock Edition. For more information about the tool used, visit [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).
